"""Shows how a market-if-touched order prices what it sends, waits when the book is empty, and refuses a negative buffer.

`MarketIfTouched.child_order` prices the order it sends `buffer_ticks` past the opposite touch: for a sell, below the best bid. This program sells 20 TCS once the price rises to 4,000, and calls `child_order` directly with a buffer of zero, two and five ticks, to show the price each would send against a best bid of 4,001.00.

When the opposite side of the book is empty there is nothing to price against, so `child_order` answers None and a tick that reaches the level does nothing, waiting for the next tick rather than guessing; the program shows this, and then the tick that fires once a bid appears. Last, a buffer of minus one tick is refused by `read_buffer_ticks` with HTTP 400.

The placement is a stand-in that chooses Zerodha and accepts every order; the event log is the `RecordingEventLog` stand-in and the parent store keeps nothing, so nothing leaves the machine.

Run it from the project root:
