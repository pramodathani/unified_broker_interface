"""Lets a GTT sell expire without its level ever being touched, and shows the validity it refuses.

A `GoodTillTriggered` order that has not been touched by the end of `valid_days` is closed as `cancelled` on the next price tick, rather than left in the record for ever. This program asks to sell 15 TCS at 4,200 once the price rises to 4,210, valid for 10 days. A tick on the ninth day at 4,150 does nothing. The first tick after the tenth day ends the parent as `cancelled` even though the price has at last reached 4,215, because the order has expired; nothing is sent.

It then shows that `read_valid_days` refuses 400 days with HTTP 400, since a trigger nobody has thought about for more than a year is more likely forgotten than intended.

`run` works out the expiry from the real time; the program pins it to ten days after Thursday 1 October 2026 so the output is the same whenever it runs, and every tick is a fixed moment. The placement is a stand-in that chooses Zerodha and accepts every order; the event log is the `RecordingEventLog` stand-in and the parent store keeps nothing, so nothing leaves the machine.

Run it from the project root:
