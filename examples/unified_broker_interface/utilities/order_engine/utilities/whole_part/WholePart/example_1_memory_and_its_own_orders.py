"""Shows what every part kept whole shares: memory kept in its part record, and limit orders of its own placed at the plan's broker.

`WholePart.remember` writes the part's memory into its part record with a message, so a restart replays it, and `own_memory` reads it back. `limit_order` builds a limit on the part's instrument from the body, at a side and price of the part's choosing, and `place_order` sends it with the part's path as the leg's role. `inventory` is the net position the part's own fills have built, `settings_problems` finds nothing for the base class, and `expanded` is how a dry run shows the part. A stand-in plays the plan order, so nothing leaves the machine.

Run it from the project root:
