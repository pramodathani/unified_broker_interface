"""Schedules a buy to trade through the closing-price window from 15:00 to 15:30, weighted by volume, and ticks the clock through it.

NSE and BSE compute an equity's closing price as the volume-weighted average of trades between 15:00 and 15:30. A `ClosingPrice` order spreads itself across that window in six slices, weighted by the usual shape of the day's volume, so what it pays is close to the closing price by construction.

This program places 600 INFY at 14:20 on Thursday 1 October 2026. The window has not opened, so `run` answers `202 scheduled` and sends nothing. The program then ticks the clock at 14:59, which sends nothing, and at 15:00, 15:05 and so on, each of which sends one slice; the slices in the last half hour of the day are the heaviest in the profile, so the later ones are larger. The parent becomes `working` when the first slice goes out.

`run` reads the time from the engine's `Moments` clock. To make the output the same on every run the program replaces that clock, in the `closing_price` module, with a stand-in that always answers 14:20 on that Thursday; every tick is also a fixed moment. The placement is a stand-in that chooses Zerodha and accepts every order; the event log is the `RecordingEventLog` stand-in and the parent store keeps nothing, so nothing leaves the machine. The trading calendar is read from the calendar files kept in the repository.

Run it from the project root:
