"""Places the four legs of an iron condor as one basket, all at one broker, and finishes when they have all filled.

A `Basket` takes a list of orders on different instruments in `synthetic.candidates` and places them in the order given, under one parent, all at the broker the first leg went to. The answer lists every leg's outcome. The caller's own body supplies what a candidate leaves out, such as the product and the order type.

This program buys the two wings before selling the two short strikes, which is the order that gets the spread's margin benefit. Once every leg has been placed the parent is `working`; the program then records each leg as filled and calls `finish_with_legs`, which is what the engine does after every order update for a type that is done once its legs are, and the parent ends as `completed`.

The placement is a stand-in that chooses Zerodha and accepts every order; the event log is the `RecordingEventLog` stand-in and the parent store keeps nothing, so nothing leaves the machine.

Run it from the project root:
