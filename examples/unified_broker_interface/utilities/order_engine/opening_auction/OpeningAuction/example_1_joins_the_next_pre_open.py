"""Places a limit buy in tomorrow's pre-open auction, so it fills at the single opening price.

An `OpeningAuction` order is a scheduled order with the pre-open's rules. On NSE and BSE the cash pre-open collects market and limit orders from 09:00 to 09:05 and limit orders alone until 09:10, and the order is placed at `at_time`, 09:00:30 by default, half a minute after collection opens.

This program asks, at 11:00 on Friday 2 October 2026, which is Gandhi Jayanti and an NSE holiday, to buy 20 RELIANCE at 1,380 in the next opening auction. `run` answers `202 scheduled` for 09:00:30 on Monday 5 October, the next trading day. (On a trading day the same request after 09:10 is refused rather than carried to the next morning; the second program shows that.) The clock tick at 09:00:29 does nothing and the one at 09:00:30 places the order. The program also prints the moment `collection_closes` gives for a limit and for a market order, and what `moment_today` makes of 09:10 on that Monday.

`run` reads the time from the engine's `Moments` clock, so the program replaces that clock, in the `opening_auction` module, with a stand-in stopped at 11:00 on that Friday; every tick is a fixed moment. The placement is a stand-in that chooses Zerodha and accepts every order; the event log is the `RecordingEventLog` stand-in and the parent store keeps nothing, so nothing leaves the machine. The trading calendar is read from the calendar files kept in the repository.

Run it from the project root:
